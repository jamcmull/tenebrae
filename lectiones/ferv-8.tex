Ego enim accépi a Dómino quod et trádidi vobis, quóniam Dóminus Jesus, in qua nocte tradebátur, accépit panem,
Et grátias agens fregit, et dixit: Accípite, et manducáte: hoc est corpus meum, quod pro vobis tradétur: hoc fácite in meam commemoratiónem.
Simíliter et cálicem, postquam c\oe návit, dicens: Hic calix novum testaméntum est in meo sánguine: hoc fácite, quotiescúmque bibétis, in meam commemoratiónem.
Quotiescúmque enim manducábitis panem hunc, et cálicem bibétis, mortem Dómini annuntiábitis donec véniat.
& \textit{For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread.
And giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me.
In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.
For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall show the death of the Lord, until he come.}
